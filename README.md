# Smithsonians_Discrete_Hilbert_Fourier_Hartley_Transforms
 An implementation from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory of some notorious transforms ready to use in c/c++

### CAREFULLY READ COMMENTS OF THE AUTHORS ABOVE THEIR FUNCTIONS IN "transforms.h" BEFORE USING THEM.

I did not write those functions, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory did. 
I just isolated the references for the transforms from a much bigger project
([https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~spaine/am/](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~spaine/am/)) and provided an example on how to use them in c++.
NOTE THAT the transforms themselves are written in c.
